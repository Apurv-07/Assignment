Question 5
Assume there is a object of this format 
var obj = {
 “id” : 4, “name” : “abc”,
 “id” : 10, “name” : “ab2”,
 “id” : 5, “name” : “abc3”,
 “id” : 6, “name” : “abc5”
}
It can be a dictionary or java object, as per your language of choice. But its key/value pair dictionary simply.

Write a code to sort the object by id 
I.e final output should have objected sort by id’s

Answer:- I think sir there must be something which is not working. First is all of them are acting like properties instead of distinct objects.
Second is they should be inside an array so that the sorting can be performed.
